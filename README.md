# Exercise Tracker (Work in Progress)

My ~~solution~~ work in Progress for the [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) project from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Current Status (`2023 May 23`):
* freeCodeCamp tests are passing (using "api v1")
* Backend Validation is DONE
* Frontend work using `Vue.js` is WIP
  * concentrating on creating a  based UI, mocking an "Admin Interface"
* MongoDB Schemas can still be optimized (relations need to be modelled still)

Planned Additions:
* User Auth

Backend:
* Nodejs
* Express (for the HTTP Server)
  * express-validator - for validation of incoming data
  * express-rate-limit - for rate-limiting incoming requests
* MongoDB via Mongoose
