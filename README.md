# Exercise Tracker (Work in Progress)

My ~~solution~~ work in Progress for the [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) project from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Current Status (`2023 Jan 17`):
* freeCodeCamp tests are passing
* Backend Validation is DONE
* Frontend work is WIP (first a vanillaJS approach, later maybe a Vue3 based solution)
* MongoDB Schemas can still be omptomized (relations need to be modelled still)

Backend:
* Nodejs
* Express (for the HTTP Server)
  * express-validator - for validation of incoming data
  * express-rate-limit - for rate-limiting incoming requests
* MongoDB via Mongoose
